## Title

Interactive Photo Gallery

## Synopsis

RWD project for the Treehouse Frontend Web Developer TechDegree

From Treehouse: "In this project, you will create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions.

"At the top of the page you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos."

## How you will be graded

To get a passing grade you'll need to submit a project that meets the following requirements. If your project receives a "Needs Work" rating on any of these tasks, then you'll need to edit your project and re-submit it until it "Meets" or "Exceeds" each task requirement.
